# 1. Create a two funcitons. Call one function from another function.

# 2. Create a script/program that will take arguments as 1,2,3,4,5, or 6 and will also
# take operands as arguments based on the selection made it will perform the
# operation and print the result.
# • 1=Addition, 2=Subtraction, 3=Multiplication, 4=Division, 5=Exponent,
# 6=Floor Division. If anything else is passed it should say Invalid argument.
# • Create a parent function which will accept the options and based on the options
# it will call nested functions for each operation. So total 7 functions will be
# created one parent and 6 nested functions.
# • According to the selection made take inputs for the operations. If 1,2,3 are
# selected take 3 inputs as operands and if 4,5,6 are selected take 2 inputs as
# operands. Perform the operation and print the result.

# 3. Fetch following items from below:
# 1. Fetch 5 which is the value of ‘e’ from below which is marked in red.
# x = {"a":1, "b":2, "c":3,"d":[1,2,3,4,(5,6,7,{"e":5})]}
# 2. Fetch 2 from below which is marked in red.
# x = {‘a’:{‘b’:[1,2,(3,4,{‘c’:3,’d’:4,’e’:[1,2,3]})]}
# 3. Fetch 6 from below which is marked in red.
# x = [1, 2, (3, 4, 5, {‘a’:1, ‘b’:[2,3,4,(5,6)]})]
# 4. Fetch 2 from above which is marked in red.
# x = {True:[1,2,3,{‘a’:1,’b’:2}],False:[(2,3,4,5,{1:2})]}
# 5. Fetch 9 from above which is marked in red.
# x = {1:2,2:3,3:4,4:{‘a’:’b’,’c’:’d’,’e’:’f’,’f’:[1,2,3,{1:9,3:8}]}

# 4. Create a function that will take unlimited arguments and should add all the
# arguments which are passed.

# 5.Print the current date using datetime and date libraries.
# 6.Convert a datetime to a string.
# 7.Get the difference between two dates in days.
# 8.Calculate your age in years, months and days.
# 9.Get the date which is 1 week from today's date.
# 10.Get the date which is 1 year from today's date.
# 11.Get the date which is 1 month from today's date.
# 12.Get the 1st day of the current month from today's date.
# 13.Get the 1st month of the current year from today's date.
# 14.Get the dates of current month starting from Monday to Sunday in a list.
# 15. Get the first date and last date of the current month.
# 16.Get me the 1st and last date of the current month in the format as following. '14th
# June 2016 Tuesday 10:00:00 AM'
